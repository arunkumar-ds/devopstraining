1. Create the file
touch /home/demo.txt

2. Set the required permissions
You want:

Owner → read, write, execute → rwx → 7

Group → read, write → rw- → 6

Others → read → r-- → 4

So the permission number is:

764

Apply it:
chmod 764 /home/demo.txt

Final Permissions Explanation

After running the command, the file will have:

-rwxrw-r--  demo.txt


Meaning:

Owner → rwx

Group → rw-

Others → r--
